# ZeroNet
Neural Network AI Implementation for SWBF (2004)

ZeroNet is the official project under development by the SWBFSpy and SWBFModders community to create neural network API for ZeroFront (the greatest PC expansion mod ever made for Star Wars Battlefront 2004), and will be implemented into ZF either before or (likely) after the release of ZeroFront v1.0. This may eventually also include assembly code reversal of the ZeroEngine source and other features such as expanded Battlefront II source and VR. Reinforcement learning servers will be hostedon SWBFSpy where the player emulation AI can train against players, bots, and other nets. Various ZeroNet NNUE files can be weighted and fine tuned with customizable CFG scriptss as they are trained to eventually reach levels of skill and tactics beyond those of even the greatest players. This adds unlimited replay value to the game and will help our servers stay even more populated. ZeroNet will be open source just like SWBFSpy, ZeroFront, ZeroBuilder. More news TBA
